## My process
1. Structured the semantic HTML
2. Wrote the general styles for the page
3. Styled the component top to bottom
4. Tweaked the layout margins/padding/sizing based on the mobile (375px-width) view

### Built with
- Semantic HTML/CSS
- Flexbox + Grid

### Challenges
1. My biggest challenge is understanding how to overlay the view icon on the NFT picture, while centering the view icon as well.
